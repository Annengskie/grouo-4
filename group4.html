	<h1> The Chosen Strand of Group 4 </h1>
	<h2> Balahadia, Christel Anne T. {HUMSS} I chose this strand because i know it will help me for the course i will take someday. I like it too, because i know i'm good at it and i've learned to choose a strand when someone tells "choose what you're good at, not what you like". </h2>
	<h2> Caalim, Helena Antonia B. {TVL} I chose TVL because for me it's easier and i like to cook. </h2>
	<h2> Longasa, Angel Erica B. {STEM} I chose STEM because it has many advantages and so that i can have knowledge about the course I will take in college. </h2>
	<h2> Delgado, Matt Zedrick D. {TVL} I chose TVL because i can learn a lot about car parts and computers here, that's why i chose strand because i love cars and computers. </h2>
